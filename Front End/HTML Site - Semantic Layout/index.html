                <h1> Super Man </h1>
                <p>By 2014, I was working in Manila, Philippines and although I was earning more than the average rate, I was not able to save or do the things I wanted in life. I felt like I needed more but there must be a consistent source or flow of income. I did not know how I would be able to achieve it and then I remembered The Secret.

                Every night as I walked home, I imagined myself finding a big amount of money on the pavement. I imagined myself living a good life and being able to travel the world and provide for my family. I only wished for PHP 100,000.00 every month. It was an impossible wish, that if it came true, it would be mind blowing, they mentioned this in the book.</p>

                <h1> Bat Man </h1>
                <p>A few months after, I was working with a client in Dubai and I had resolved their issue. A few weeks after, they contacted me and offered me a job worth PHP 195,000.00!!

                Imagine how the universe gave me more than what I have asked for! It is indeed true that money comes easily. I am now working here in Dubai and have traveled to 5 countries in less than a year.

                Now things are much better from when I look back to almost two years ago, but I have never stopped being grateful and applying The Secret in my life. Today, I have placed an order to the universe and I am sure I will be given me an answer again: “Your wish is my command.”</p>

                <h1> Wonder Woman </h1>
                <p>It all started when I met the most beautiful, kind, and loving woman. Nicole became my savior, and eventually my wife. She taught me about The Secret and how to maintain positivity, thankfulness, and how to manifest what we wanted for our life.

                I had just came back from a deployment to Afghanistan and found out my wife at the time didn’t want to be married to me anymore: a face to face Dear John letter. I was devastated and there was nothing I could do about it. Luckily I had some really great Army buddies to get me through it. But after a couple months of way too many bars and guys trips, I decided I would try a dating website to find a soul mate, not just some random girl at a bar.

                I was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, but I set up my profile for the Raleigh area because there were way more young professionals there. Nicole was the first person I went on a date with through the site. I had messaged with a few people, but Nicole was the first person I felt a connection with that was worth meeting in person. She was a fifth grade teacher who had relocated to NC from Michigan. I told her how I had a crush on my fifth grade teacher, and that I was sure there were some little guys in her class crushing hard. Plus, I told her how I thought she looked like the MTV reality star Lauren Conrad. Those two things must have flattered her enough, because we set up a date for an upcoming weekend.</p>

                <h1> Spider Man </h1>
                <p>We have been together almost eight years now. My life has completely changed because of how The Secret manifested through Nicole. I got out of the Army so I could start a family I could be there for, and I am now an educator, too. We have two beautiful children together. We live in our dream home that literally came to us because of The Secret (another great post about the law of attraction). We both have our dream careers in her home state of Michigan too, another great story about faith in the universe.

                Here are a few universe lessons we live by.

                Have constant gratitude and give often, it comes right back to you.</p>
